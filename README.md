# WaterLevelMonitor
IoT application that monitors water level in the tank

This project displays the level of water in percentage, in any device that has a web-browser and is connected to the same LAN as the ESP32 used. It is highly recommended, that you set up a Static IP in your router and configure the “Server.ino” code accordingly, for the project. For that, you might need access to your router’s configuration web-page. It is highly recommended, that you insulate the harware against water vapour, that might condense on the harware in the long run. You will require the below hardware and software for this project.

1. NODEMCU ESP32S (Development board)
2. Micro-USB cable
3. HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic sensor)
4. WiFi connection (WiFi Extender, if needed)
5. Multi-wood sheet
6. Insulation tape
7. Scissors
8. Glue gun
9. Soldering iron
10. Dot board
11. Power adapter and AC supply
12. Computer (preferably, Laptop)
13. Arduino IDE (with ESP32 library)
